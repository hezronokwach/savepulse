## Opening:
* "Hi everyone, let me introduce you to SavePulse, a platform designed to restore trust in blood donation systems, starting in Kenya but deployable anywhere in the world."

## Problem:
* "Four years ago, Kenya was shaken by revelations that some entrusted staff were selling donated blood. This broke the trust of many potential donors, especially among people aged 18 to 45-healthy, well-informed individuals who want to donate but doubt the system’s integrity due to vulnerabilities like this."

## Solution:
* "SavePulse is a web and mobile application that restores confidence by providing complete transparency. Donors register and get a unique ID, book appointments, and donate blood. From there, they can track their blood’s journey-from screening to its final use in hospitals. At every step, the system keeps donors informed and engaged."

## Core Features:
* "The app ensures donors know exactly what happens to their blood. If it passes screening, the status updates in their dashboard. If it’s used at a hospital, they receive a thank-you message for saving a life. This traceability rebuilds trust and encourages repeat donations."

## Admin Role:
* "To ensure system integrity, hospitals, satellite centers, and regional blood banks are onboarded and managed through an admin interface."

## Global Potential:
* "While SavePulse addresses Kenya’s immediate challenges, the app is designed to be deployed anywhere in the world, adapting to local needs and contexts. Blood donation systems globally face similar trust issues, making this a scalable solution."

## Technologies:
* "Using Next.js for the frontend and Gin for the backend, SavePulse offers a secure, efficient, and user-friendly experience."

## Closing:
* "SavePulse isn’t just an app; it’s a tool to restore faith in blood donation systems and inspire action. By enhancing transparency, we can encourage more people to donate blood and save lives-whether in Kenya or beyond. Thank you!"
